## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Freshness round trip (R2 + D1 tag cache + DO queue, signed webhook) is proven on a deployed Worker in Phase 1, before any styled UI
- [Roadmap]: No `cacheComponents` / `'use cache'`; guard test lands in Phase 1
- [Roadmap]: Shop seam (`src/shop/`) and the shop-strings guard test land in Phase 2 with the design system

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 1]: Freshness round trip on a deployed Worker is unproven (research flag, highest). Settle `{ expire: 0 }` vs `'max'` and `force-cache` after `await searchParams`
- [Phase 1]: OpenNext cannot build on Windows. Build and deploy from Linux CI or WSL only
- [Phase 3]: Ralph Lauren spelling (`ralph-lauren` vs `polo-ralph-lauren`) and `arc-teryx.svg` rename to `arcteryx.svg` need confirming
- [Phase 4]: Sold-before brand tier has no data source (BRAND-02 ships with it empty; BRAND-05 is v2)
- [Phase 4]: Default brand order and lifestyle photos (hero, 2 banners, 4 category tiles, story band) still to come from the owner
